   abstract = {Filtration capacity and feeding behaviour has been intensely studied for adult mussels (Mytilus edulis), but less information is available for juvenile mussels (1.5-25 mm, < 1 year), especially in natural sea water. The recent introduction of mussel seed collectors in the Netherlands prompted the need for more detailed information on juvenile mussel behaviour. To estimate the impact of juvenile populations on ecosystem carrying capacity, information on clearance rate as well as usage of different prey items is essential. Clearance rates were measured in an experimental study, incubating juvenile mussels in natural sea water. Rates were related to isometrics as well as specified for the prey items bacteria, picophytoplankton (< 3 mu m), nanophytoplankton (3-20 mu m), and ciliates. Results showed that the clearance rate of juvenile mussels depends on shell length(2), while the relationship between clearance rate and weight was more variable. Length is thus a better parameter for estimating clearance rate than weight. Ciliates and nanophytoplankton were cleared at comparable, but variable rates, while picoalgae were cleared from the water at the rate of 11-64 % compared to nanophytoplankton. For bacteria, the clearance rate was on average 9 %. This study showed different retention of particles of similar size (picoalgae and bacteria) as well as variability in particle retention for the different prey items. This variable retention efficiency could not be related to seston concentration nor to dominance in cell size. The results from this study can be used to estimate the effect of mussel seed collectors on the carrying capacity of the Dutch Wadden Sea.},

   title = {Comparison of eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) filtration rates at low temperatures},
   institution = {Fisheries and Oceans Canada},
   abstract = {Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) were collected in the Gulf of St. Lawrence at the northernmost distribution area of C. virginica and maintained in cold water (0°C, 4°C or 9°C) over a 63-day period. Filtration rates were periodically determined in closed chambers initially inoculated with 10,000 phytoplankton cells mL-1. For C. virginica, filtration at low temperatures was clearly an exception: the percentage of the experimental population clearing the phytoplankton cells from the closed chambers declined from peak values of 50% at 9°C to null values (no animals filtering) at 0°C. For M. edulis, the percentage ranged from 100% at 9°C to 17% at 0°C. With respect to absolute filtration rates, C. virginica cleared significantly fewer particles than did M. edulis. Moreover, unlike M. edulis, C. virginica showed no adaptation to cold during the 63-day experiment. Together these results suggest that C. virginica is disadvantaged in terms of grazing on seasonal phytoplankton blooms, including toxic (domoic acid) blooms, which have historically occurred at low temperatures (< 9°C) in eastern Canadian waters. We caution, however, that further experiments are required to ascertain how changes in food quality or availability may influence feeding behaviour of C. virginica at low temperatures.},
